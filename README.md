## Basics

There is an elements rulebook. It controls the rules of the sandbox.  
It is human-readable, however, it requires strict syntax, so it's a bit annoying, but you get used to that eventually.

If you take a quick look-through, you will see some obvious numbers that can be changed.
Some examples, are the color values. These are easily changable, but remember, ***strict syntax***!
