## Basics

There is an elements rulebook. It controls the rules of the sandbox.  
It is human-readable, however, it requires strict syntax, so it's a bit annoying, but you get used to that eventually.

If you take a quick look-through, you will see some obvious numbers that can be changed.  
Some examples, are the color values. These are easily changable, but remember, ***strict syntax***!  
You may also notice the chances for falling. These chances are in percent, and they don't support floating point.

## Playing

Use `python3.11 .` to start.  
Click on one of the element names to switch to that element.  
Click and hold on the canvas to put that element on the canvas wherever your cursor is.  
Use the number keys to edit the size of your brush.  
Click the `Pause` button on the top of the gray panel to pause. It should now say `Paused`. Click again to unpause it.
